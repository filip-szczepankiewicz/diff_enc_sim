### Scope
This code provides a simple framework for visualizing and animating the effect of diffusion encoding on spin along a single direction in space. The code was prepared for the ISMRM 2019 diffusion MRI Educational session: [Diffusion & Microstructure: Fundamentals & Frontiers](https://www.ismrm.org/19/program_files/WE05.htm) for the lecture [Diffusion MRI Acquisition, Part I: From Propagator to Image](https://cds.ismrm.org/protected/19MPresentations/eduvids/11/710B/0845/) (login is required to access the lecture video).

This set of functions can be used to visualize the phase over time for arbitrary field gradients for diffusing particles where the movement can be arbitrarily defined (e.g. based on a gaussian propagator). An assortment of .gif animations is available in the /animations/ folder.

Start by executing the example code, e.g. `des_example_1` which should render the animation below. Note that the code does not include tools for making .gif animations, as this is a bit more involved. I may include this in the future if requested.
